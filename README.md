# Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset Analysis

This project contains a comprehensive data analysis and visualization study on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. Various visualization techniques and statistical analyses were used to understand diabetes risk factors and identify variables associated with diabetes.

## About the Dataset

The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset contains data from a diabetes study conducted among the Pima Indian population in Arizona. The dataset includes various health measurements that can be used to diagnose diabetes in women aged 21 and older.

## Project Content

The following analyses and visualizations were performed in this project:

### 1. Pie Charts
- Distribution of patients with and without diabetes
- Distribution of patients by BMI categories
- Distribution of patients by age groups

### 2. Bar Charts
- Number of patients with and without diabetes
- Distribution of diabetes by age groups
- Distribution of diabetes by glucose levels

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Correlation matrix between variables
- Correlation between diabetes and other variables
- Pairplot
- Boxplots

## Findings

As a result of the analyses, the variables with the strongest relationship to diabetes are:
1. Glucose level (r = 0.467)
2. BMI (Body Mass Index) (r = 0.293)
3. Age (r = 0.238)
4. Number of pregnancies (r = 0.222)

These findings provide important information for understanding diabetes risk factors and developing machine learning models for diabetes prediction.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
